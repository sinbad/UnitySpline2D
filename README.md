# Unity Spline2D

> #### Note: I have stopped using Unity and so am not maintaining this library any more.

Unity Spline2D is a free 2D simple spline library for Unity.

## Features

* **Easy to use**: define a series of intersection points and that's it. The spline
  will pass through those points with a default Catmull-Rom curvature. No
  need to set tangent control points.
* **Positions and Derivatives**: get both a position on the curve and its 
  derivative (to get facing)
* **Interpolate by Distance**: interpolating by `t` alone can result in varied
  speeds along the curve if your points are not equidistant. With Spline2D you
  can ask for a position a specific distance along the curve instead, and therefore
  traverse the curve at a known speed regardless of the structure of the curve.
* **Tweakable curvature**: if you want something other than Catmull-Rom style
  curves, you can increase/decrease the `Curvature` property to change the shape
* **Optimised for 2D**: always flat, defaults to X/Y like 2D mode in Unity 
  but can be switched to display/edit in X/Z for use with 3D floor planes

## Installation
* Place `Spline2D.cs` and `Spline2DComponent.cs` anywhere you like
* Place `Spline2DInspector.cs` in an `Editor` subfolder somewhere.

## Usage: 

* To just use splines from general code, instantiate `Spline2D` and call its
  AddPoint methods etc to build the spline
* To use a spline in a scene & save it, use `Spline2DComponent` as a regular
  Unity component. There is a inspector with buttons to add/remove points, and
  you can select points and drag them around to change the curve.
